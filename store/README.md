Perfect, now that I see your **Store service**, we can summarize it clearly for your `README.md`. Here's a concise, readable version that highlights your **event-driven, inventory/reservation logic** without going too deep into implementation:

## Store Service (Warehouse / Inventory)

The **Store Service** manages ingredient availability, reservations, and purchases for the restaurant system. It ensures that orders can be fulfilled reliably using event-driven communication with the Kitchen Service.

### Key Features

1. **Ingredient Availability Checks**

   * Listens to `ingredientAvailabilityRequestTopic`.
   * Checks inventory for requested ingredients.
   * Temporarily reserves available ingredients for orders.

2. **Reservation Management**

   * Tracks temporary ingredient reservations in memory.
   * Confirms reservations and decrements inventory on `orderCompletedTopic`.
   * Cancels reservations if an order expires (`orderExpiredTopic`).

3. **Handling Shortages**

   * Listens to `ingredientShortageTopic` for unavailable ingredients.
   * Uses `IngredientPurchaseService` to request purchases from suppliers.
   * Re-publishes availability requests once new stock arrives.

4. **Order Processing**

   * `AvailabilityIngredientService` processes order requests.
   * Validates ingredient quantities.
   * Retries ingredient purchases if stock is insufficient.
   * Returns a detailed map of processed plates and ingredients for Kitchen Service.

### Event Flow (Simplified)

```
KitchenService ---> ingredientAvailabilityRequestTopic ---> StoreService
StoreService ---> ingredientReservedTopic ---> KitchenService
StoreService ---> ingredientShortageTopic ---> PurchaseOrderConsumer ---> ingredientAvailabilityRequestTopic
KitchenService ---> orderCompletedTopic ---> StoreService (confirm inventory)
KitchenService ---> orderExpiredTopic ---> StoreService (cancel reservation)
```

### Notes / Improvements

* Implements **optimistic locking / transactional updates** for inventory consistency.
* Handles **temporary reservations** to prevent overbooking.
* Supports **automatic purchase requests** on shortages.
* Uses **Kafka for asynchronous communication**, enabling reliable and decoupled workflows.

If you want, I can **also merge the Kitchen + Store service flows into a single visual diagram** for your README so anyone can understand the full end-to-end order lifecycle at a glance.

Do you want me to do that?
